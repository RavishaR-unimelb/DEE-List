Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of SLC23A2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 12 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including ATP6V0A1 (pathways: disease), MOCS1 (pathways: defective amn causes hereditary megaloblastic anemia 1|disease|metabolism), CACNA1A (pathways: metabolism), suggesting that SLC23A2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between SLC23A2–PNPO (importance score of 0.885 and connected through pathways: defective amn causes hereditary megaloblastic anemia 1|disease|metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of SLC23A2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
