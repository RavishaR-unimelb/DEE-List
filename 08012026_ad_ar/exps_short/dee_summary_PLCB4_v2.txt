Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of PLCB4 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 10 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including MOCS1 (pathways: metabolism), STXBP1 (pathways: metabolism), SUCLA2 (pathways: metabolism), suggesting that PLCB4 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between PLCB4–PNPO (importance score of 0.824 and connected through pathways: metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of PLCB4 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
