Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of CPLX2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 10 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including ATP1A2 (pathways: synaptic vesicle pathway), SYT1 (pathways: synaptic vesicle pathway), SNAP25 (pathways: synaptic vesicle pathway), suggesting that CPLX2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between CPLX2–CPLX1 (importance score of 0.896 and connected through pathways: synaptic vesicle pathway), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of CPLX2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
