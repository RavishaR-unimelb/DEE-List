Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of DHCR7 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 13 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including TBL1XR1 (pathways: activation of gene expression by srebf (srebp)|metabolism|metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins|regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by srebp (srebf)), PDHA1 (pathways: metabolism), L2HGDH (pathways: metabolism), suggesting that DHCR7 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between DHCR7–PNPO (importance score of 0.888 and connected through pathways: metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of DHCR7 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
