Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of GNA11 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 11 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including SLC25A1 (pathways: metabolism), STXBP1 (pathways: integration of energy metabolism|metabolism|regulation of insulin secretion), PRODH (pathways: metabolism), suggesting that GNA11 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between GNA11–PNPO (importance score of 0.91 and connected through pathways: metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of GNA11 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
