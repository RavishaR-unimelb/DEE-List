Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of EIF1AX as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 17 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PIGN (pathways: metabolism of proteins), EIF2B3 (pathways: cap-dependent translation initiation|gene expression|metabolism of proteins|translation|translation factors), CHD3 (pathways: gene expression), suggesting that EIF1AX may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between EIF1AX–PIGO (importance score of 0.831 and connected through pathways: metabolism of proteins), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of EIF1AX in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
