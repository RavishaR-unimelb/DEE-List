Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of NAPA as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 11 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including SYT1 (pathways: synaptic vesicle pathway), CLTC (pathways: clathrin derived vesicle budding|golgi associated vesicle biogenesis|membrane trafficking|synaptic vesicle pathway), OCRL (pathways: clathrin derived vesicle budding|golgi associated vesicle biogenesis|membrane trafficking), suggesting that NAPA may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between NAPA–STXBP1 (importance score of 0.801 and connected through pathways: synaptic vesicle pathway), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of NAPA in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
