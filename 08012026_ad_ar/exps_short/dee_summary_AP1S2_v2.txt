Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of AP1S2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 13 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including KIF2A (pathways: adaptive immune system|immune system|mhc class ii antigen presentation), PPP2R5D (pathways: adaptive immune system|disease|immune system), TBL1XR1 (pathways: disease), suggesting that AP1S2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between AP1S2–SPTBN2 (importance score of 0.894 and connected through pathways: adaptive immune system|immune system|mhc class ii antigen presentation), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of AP1S2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
