Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of ATXN7 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 14 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including SMARCB1 (pathways: chromatin modifying enzymes), HDAC3 (pathways: chromatin modifying enzymes), SMARCA2 (pathways: chromatin modifying enzymes), suggesting that ATXN7 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between ATXN7–ACTL6B (importance score of 0.91 and connected through pathways: chromatin modifying enzymes), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of ATXN7 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
