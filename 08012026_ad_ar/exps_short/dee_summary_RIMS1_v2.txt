Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of RIMS1 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 16 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including STX1B (pathways: synaptic vesicle pathway), GABRB3 (pathways: neuronal system|transmission across chemical synapses), SYN1 (pathways: dopamine neurotransmitter release cycle|neuronal system|neurotransmitter release cycle|transmission across chemical synapses|synaptic vesicle pathway), suggesting that RIMS1 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between RIMS1–CPLX2 (importance score of 0.89 and connected through pathways: synaptic vesicle pathway), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of RIMS1 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
