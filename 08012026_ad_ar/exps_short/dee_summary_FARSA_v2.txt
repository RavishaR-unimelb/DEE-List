Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of FARSA as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 13 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PARS2 (pathways: trna aminoacylation|gene expression), TBL1XR1 (pathways: gene expression), EFTUD2 (pathways: gene expression), suggesting that FARSA may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between FARSA–EIF2B4 (importance score of 0.907 and connected through pathways: gene expression), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of FARSA in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
