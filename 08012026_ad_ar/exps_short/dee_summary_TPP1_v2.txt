Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of TPP1 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 17 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including KIF5B (pathways: metabolism of proteins), PIGV (pathways: metabolism of proteins), ALG8 (pathways: metabolism of proteins), suggesting that TPP1 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between TPP1–EXOSC3 (importance score of 0.902 and connected through pathways: metabolism of proteins|unfolded protein response (upr)), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of TPP1 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
