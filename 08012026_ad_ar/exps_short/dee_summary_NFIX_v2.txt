Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of NFIX as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 18 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including USP9X (pathways: gene expression), IARS2 (pathways: gene expression), ADAR (pathways: gene expression), suggesting that NFIX may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between NFIX–RANBP2 (importance score of 0.791 and connected through pathways: gene expression), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of NFIX in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
