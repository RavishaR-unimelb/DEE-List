Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of TUBB2B as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 12 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including RANBP2 (pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), PIGQ (pathways: metabolism of proteins), UNC79 (pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), suggesting that TUBB2B may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between TUBB2B–PIGO (importance score of 0.892 and connected through pathways: metabolism of proteins), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of TUBB2B in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
