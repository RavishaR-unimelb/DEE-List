Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of TCF20 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Among the most influential links is the interaction between TCF20–MMP9 (importance score of 0.857 and connected through pathways: matrix metalloproteinases), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of TCF20 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
