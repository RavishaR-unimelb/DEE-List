Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of ACSL4 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 9 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including TBL1XR1 (pathways: fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism|metabolism|metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins), SUCLG1 (pathways: metabolism), PCCB (pathways: fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism|metabolism|metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins), suggesting that ACSL4 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between ACSL4–SLC23A2 (importance score of 0.827 and connected through pathways: metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of ACSL4 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
