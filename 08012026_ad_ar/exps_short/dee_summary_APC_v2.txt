Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of APC as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 11 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including STRADA (pathways: signaling pathways), STX1B (pathways: disease), BTD (pathways: disease), suggesting that APC may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between APC–TPK1 (importance score of 0.872 and connected through pathways: disease), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of APC in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
