Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of SPTBN2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 12 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including TRIP12 (pathways: adaptive immune system|immune system), SCN2A (pathways: axon guidance|developmental biology|interaction between l1 and ankyrins|l1cam interactions), PLXNA1 (pathways: axon guidance|developmental biology), suggesting that SPTBN2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between SPTBN2–UBE2A (importance score of 0.887 and connected through pathways: adaptive immune system|immune system), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of SPTBN2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
