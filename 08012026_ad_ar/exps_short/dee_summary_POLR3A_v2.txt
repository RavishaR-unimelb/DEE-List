Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of POLR3A as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 14 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including CHD3 (pathways: gene expression|rna polymerase i, rna polymerase iii, and mitochondrial transcription|transcription), EIF2B3 (pathways: gene expression), TRIP12 (pathways: immune system), suggesting that POLR3A may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between POLR3A–UBA5 (importance score of 0.874 and connected through pathways: immune system), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of POLR3A in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
