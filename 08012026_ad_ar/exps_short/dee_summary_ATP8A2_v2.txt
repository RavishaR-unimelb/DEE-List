Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of ATP8A2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 7 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including CREBBP (pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), SLC9A6 (pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), SLC2A1 (pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), suggesting that ATP8A2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between ATP8A2–RANBP2 (importance score of 0.963 and connected through pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of ATP8A2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
