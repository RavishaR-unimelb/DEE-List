Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of CHP1 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 10 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including SUCLA2 (pathways: metabolism), TBL1XR1 (pathways: disease|metabolism), D2HGDH (pathways: metabolism), suggesting that CHP1 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between CHP1–IDUA (importance score of 0.942 and connected through pathways: carbohydrate metabolism|defective b3gat3 causes jdssdhd|disease|metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of CHP1 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
