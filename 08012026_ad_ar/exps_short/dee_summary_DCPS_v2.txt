Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of DCPS as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 16 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including NARS2 (pathways: gene expression), TBL1XR1 (pathways: gene expression), HNRNPU (pathways: gene expression), suggesting that DCPS may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between DCPS–SMC1A (importance score of 0.852 and connected through pathways: gene expression), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of DCPS in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
