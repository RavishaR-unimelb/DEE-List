Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of GLRB as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 6 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including RANBP2 (pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), UNC79 (pathways: ion channel transport|transmembrane transport of small molecules), GABRB3 (pathways: ion channel transport|ligand-gated ion channel transport|transmembrane transport of small molecules), suggesting that GLRB may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between GLRB–SLC27A1 (importance score of 0.886 and connected through pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of GLRB in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
