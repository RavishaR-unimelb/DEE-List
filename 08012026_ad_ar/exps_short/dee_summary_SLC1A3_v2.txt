Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of SLC1A3 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 6 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including KCNQ3 (pathways: neuronal system), KCNQ5 (pathways: neuronal system), RANBP2 (pathways: slc-mediated transmembrane transport|transmembrane transport of small molecules), suggesting that SLC1A3 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between SLC1A3–UNC80 (importance score of 0.906 and connected through pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of SLC1A3 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
