Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of NDUFB8 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 12 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including SUCLA2 (pathways: metabolism|the citric acid (tca) cycle and respiratory electron transport), PDHA1 (pathways: metabolism|the citric acid (tca) cycle and respiratory electron transport), CACNA1A (pathways: metabolism), suggesting that NDUFB8 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between NDUFB8–TPK1 (importance score of 0.797 and connected through pathways: metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of NDUFB8 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
