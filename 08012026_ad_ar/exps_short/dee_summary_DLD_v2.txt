Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of DLD as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 10 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PCCB (pathways: metabolism), MOCS1 (pathways: metabolism), PRODH (pathways: amino acid and derivative metabolism|metabolism), suggesting that DLD may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between DLD–HADHB (importance score of 0.895 and connected through pathways: metabolism|fatty acid beta oxidation), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of DLD in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
