Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of EMD as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 6 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PPP2R5D (pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic|m phase|mitotic anaphase|mitotic m-m/g1 phases|mitotic metaphase and anaphase), DYRK1A (pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic), PPP2R1A (pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic|initiation of nuclear envelope reformation|m phase|mitotic anaphase|mitotic m-m/g1 phases|mitotic metaphase and anaphase|mitotic prophase), suggesting that EMD may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between EMD–SMC1A (importance score of 0.787 and connected through pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic|m phase|mitotic anaphase|mitotic m-m/g1 phases|mitotic metaphase and anaphase), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of EMD in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
