Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of DLG3 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 16 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including KCNC1 (pathways: neuronal system), TBL1XR1 (pathways: developmental biology), SPTAN1 (pathways: axon guidance|developmental biology|l1cam interactions), suggesting that DLG3 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between DLG3–CPLX1 (importance score of 0.891 and connected through pathways: neuronal system|transmission across chemical synapses), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of DLG3 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
