Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of TTC21B as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 11 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including TRRAP (pathways: signaling pathways), CCDC88C (pathways: signaling pathways), MEF2C (pathways: signaling pathways), suggesting that TTC21B may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between TTC21B–ATP6V0A1 (importance score of 0.828 and connected through pathways: signaling pathways), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of TTC21B in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
