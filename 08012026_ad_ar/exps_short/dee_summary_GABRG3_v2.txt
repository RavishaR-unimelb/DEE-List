Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of GABRG3 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 12 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including SYN1 (pathways: neuronal system|transmission across chemical synapses), GABRG2 (pathways: gaba a receptor activation|gaba receptor activation|ion channel transport|ligand-gated ion channel transport|neuronal system|neurotransmitter receptor binding and downstream transmission in the postsynaptic cell|orphan transporters|transmembrane transport of small molecules|transmission across chemical synapses), CACNA1A (pathways: neuronal system|transmission across chemical synapses), suggesting that GABRG3 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between GABRG3–ABCA12 (importance score of 0.937 and connected through pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of GABRG3 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
