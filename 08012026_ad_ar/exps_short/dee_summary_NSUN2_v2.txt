Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of NSUN2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 2 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PPP2R5D (pathways: aurora b signaling), CUL3 (pathways: aurora b signaling), suggesting that NSUN2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between NSUN2–PPP2R5D (importance score of 0.824 and connected through pathways: aurora b signaling), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of NSUN2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
