Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of UBE3B as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 10 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including MEF2C (pathways: immune system), PPP2R5D (pathways: adaptive immune system|immune system), PAK3 (pathways: adaptive immune system|immune system), suggesting that UBE3B may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between UBE3B–SPTBN2 (importance score of 0.835 and connected through pathways: adaptive immune system|immune system), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of UBE3B in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
