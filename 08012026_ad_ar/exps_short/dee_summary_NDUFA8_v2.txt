Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of NDUFA8 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 10 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including CACNA1A (pathways: metabolism), TBL1XR1 (pathways: metabolism), SUCLG1 (pathways: metabolism|the citric acid (tca) cycle and respiratory electron transport), suggesting that NDUFA8 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between NDUFA8–RANBP2 (importance score of 0.765 and connected through pathways: metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of NDUFA8 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
