Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of CACNA2D3 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 15 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including SNAP25 (pathways: neuronal system|transmission across chemical synapses), ALDH5A1 (pathways: neuronal system|transmission across chemical synapses), GABRA1 (pathways: neuronal system|transmission across chemical synapses), suggesting that CACNA2D3 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between CACNA2D3–GRIA3 (importance score of 0.931 and connected through pathways: neuronal system|transmission across chemical synapses), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of CACNA2D3 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
