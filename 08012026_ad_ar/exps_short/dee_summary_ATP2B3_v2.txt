Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of ATP2B3 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 11 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including RANBP2 (pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), ATP2B2 (pathways: hemostasis|ion channel transport|ion transport by p-type atpases|platelet calcium homeostasis|platelet homeostasis|reduction of cytosolic ca++ levels|transmembrane transport of small molecules|calcium regulation in the cardiac cell), TUBB2A (pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), suggesting that ATP2B3 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between ATP2B3–GABRG2 (importance score of 0.896 and connected through pathways: ion channel transport|transmembrane transport of small molecules), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of ATP2B3 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
