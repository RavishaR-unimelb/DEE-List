Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of TUBGCP4 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 9 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PPP2R1A (pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic|centrosome maturation|g2/m transition|mitotic g2-g2/m phases), TUBB (pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic|centrosome maturation|g2/m transition|mitotic g2-g2/m phases), TUBGCP2 (pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic|centrosome maturation|g2/m transition|mitotic g2-g2/m phases|recruitment of numa to mitotic centrosomes), suggesting that TUBGCP4 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between TUBGCP4–RANBP2 (importance score of 0.843 and connected through pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of TUBGCP4 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
