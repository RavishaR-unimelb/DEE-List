Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of ATP6AP1 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 10 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including NDUFV1 (pathways: oxidative phosphorylation), UNC79 (pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), NDUFS1 (pathways: oxidative phosphorylation), suggesting that ATP6AP1 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between ATP6AP1–RANBP2 (importance score of 0.87 and connected through pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of ATP6AP1 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
