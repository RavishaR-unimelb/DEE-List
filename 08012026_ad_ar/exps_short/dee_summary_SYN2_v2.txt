Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of SYN2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 14 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including GABRG2 (pathways: neuronal system|transmission across chemical synapses), GABRB3 (pathways: neuronal system|transmission across chemical synapses), STX1B (pathways: synaptic vesicle pathway), suggesting that SYN2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between SYN2–SYP (importance score of 0.894 and connected through pathways: synaptic vesicle pathway), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of SYN2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
