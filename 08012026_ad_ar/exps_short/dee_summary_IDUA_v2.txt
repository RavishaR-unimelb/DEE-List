Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of IDUA as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 11 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PDHA1 (pathways: metabolism), SUCLG1 (pathways: metabolism), PCCB (pathways: disease|metabolism), suggesting that IDUA may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between IDUA–PNPO (importance score of 0.89 and connected through pathways: disease|metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of IDUA in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
