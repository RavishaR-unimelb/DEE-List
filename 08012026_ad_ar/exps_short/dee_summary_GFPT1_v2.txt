Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of GFPT1 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 14 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PIGV (pathways: metabolism of proteins|post-translational protein modification), ALG2 (pathways: asparagine n-linked glycosylation|biosynthesis of the n-glycan precursor (dolichol lipid-linked oligosaccharide, llo) and transfer to a nascent protein|metabolism of proteins|post-translational protein modification), HNRNPU (pathways: circadian rythm related genes), suggesting that GFPT1 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between GFPT1–PIGO (importance score of 0.865 and connected through pathways: metabolism of proteins|post-translational protein modification), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of GFPT1 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
