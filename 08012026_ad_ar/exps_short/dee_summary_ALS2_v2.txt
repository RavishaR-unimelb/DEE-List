Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of ALS2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 2 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including SLC1A2 (pathways: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als)), GRIA1 (pathways: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als)), suggesting that ALS2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between ALS2–SLC1A2 (importance score of 0.833 and connected through pathways: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als)), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of ALS2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
