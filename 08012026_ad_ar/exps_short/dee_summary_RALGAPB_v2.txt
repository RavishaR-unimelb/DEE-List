Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of RALGAPB as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 7 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including DNM1 (pathways: membrane trafficking), PUM1 (pathways: membrane trafficking), VAMP2 (pathways: membrane trafficking|translocation of glut4 to the plasma membrane), suggesting that RALGAPB may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between RALGAPB–AP1S2 (importance score of 0.866 and connected through pathways: membrane trafficking), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of RALGAPB in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
