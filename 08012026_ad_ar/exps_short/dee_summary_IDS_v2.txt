Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of IDS as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 13 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including L2HGDH (pathways: metabolism), PACS1 (pathways: disease), PDHA1 (pathways: metabolism), suggesting that IDS may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between IDS–PCCB (importance score of 0.888 and connected through pathways: disease|metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of IDS in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
