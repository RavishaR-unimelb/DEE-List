Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of CTNND2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 9 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including ELOVL4 (pathways: ectoderm differentiation), CTNNA2 (pathways: ectoderm differentiation), GLB1 (pathways: ectoderm differentiation), suggesting that CTNND2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between CTNND2–ARX (importance score of 0.857 and connected through pathways: ectoderm differentiation), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of CTNND2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
