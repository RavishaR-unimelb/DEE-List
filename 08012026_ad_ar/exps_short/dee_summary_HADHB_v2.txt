Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of HADHB as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 12 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including CACNA1A (pathways: metabolism), SDHA (pathways: metabolism), SUCLA2 (pathways: metabolism), suggesting that HADHB may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between HADHB–SLC25A1 (importance score of 0.855 and connected through pathways: fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism|metabolism|metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of HADHB in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
