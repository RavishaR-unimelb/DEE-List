Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of GDI1 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 10 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including OPHN1 (pathways: rho gtpase cycle|signaling pathways), RAC3 (pathways: rho gtpase cycle|signaling pathways), CREBBP (pathways: signaling pathways), suggesting that GDI1 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between GDI1–GNB1 (importance score of 0.893 and connected through pathways: signaling pathways), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of GDI1 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
