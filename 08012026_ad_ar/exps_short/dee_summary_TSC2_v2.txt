Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of TSC2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 12 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including OPHN1 (pathways: signaling pathways), RANBP2 (pathways: disease|immune system), ATP6V0A1 (pathways: disease|signaling pathways|signaling by insulin receptor), suggesting that TSC2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between TSC2–GDI1 (importance score of 0.925 and connected through pathways: signaling pathways|integrated breast cancer pathway), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of TSC2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
