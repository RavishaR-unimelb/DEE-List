Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of TSC1 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 10 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including TRRAP (pathways: signaling pathways), OPHN1 (pathways: signaling pathways), MEF2C (pathways: signaling pathways), suggesting that TSC1 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between TSC1–GNB1 (importance score of 0.865 and connected through pathways: signaling pathways), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of TSC1 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
