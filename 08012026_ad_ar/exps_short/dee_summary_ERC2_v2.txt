Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of ERC2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 5 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PIGF (pathways: diurnally regulated genes with circadian orthologs), UGP2 (pathways: diurnally regulated genes with circadian orthologs), NCKAP1 (pathways: diurnally regulated genes with circadian orthologs), suggesting that ERC2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between ERC2–PURA (importance score of 0.901 and connected through pathways: diurnally regulated genes with circadian orthologs), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of ERC2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
