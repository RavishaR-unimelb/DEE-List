Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of SETX as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 4 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including RAI1 (pathways: circadian rythm related genes), DYRK1A (pathways: circadian rythm related genes), KCNH7 (pathways: circadian rythm related genes), suggesting that SETX may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between SETX–GFPT1 (importance score of 0.882 and connected through pathways: circadian rythm related genes), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of SETX in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
