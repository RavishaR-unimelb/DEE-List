Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of KCNC3 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 16 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including GRIA4 (pathways: neuronal system), GABRA1 (pathways: neuronal system), GABRB3 (pathways: neuronal system), suggesting that KCNC3 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between KCNC3–KCNQ5 (importance score of 0.925 and connected through pathways: neuronal system|potassium channels|voltage gated potassium channels), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of KCNC3 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
