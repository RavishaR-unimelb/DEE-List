Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of RAB3A as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 13 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including CACNA1A (pathways: neuronal system|transmission across chemical synapses|synaptic vesicle pathway), CDKL5 (pathways: bdnf signaling pathway), CPLX1 (pathways: acetylcholine neurotransmitter release cycle|dopamine neurotransmitter release cycle|gaba synthesis, release, reuptake and degradation|glutamate neurotransmitter release cycle|neuronal system|neurotransmitter release cycle|norepinephrine neurotransmitter release cycle|transmission across chemical synapses|synaptic vesicle pathway), suggesting that RAB3A may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between RAB3A–KCNQ2 (importance score of 0.893 and connected through pathways: neuronal system), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of RAB3A in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
