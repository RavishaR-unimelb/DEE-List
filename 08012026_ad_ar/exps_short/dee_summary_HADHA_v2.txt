Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of HADHA as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 14 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including TPK1 (pathways: metabolism), SDHA (pathways: metabolism), CACNA1A (pathways: metabolism), suggesting that HADHA may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between HADHA–STXBP1 (importance score of 0.885 and connected through pathways: metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of HADHA in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
