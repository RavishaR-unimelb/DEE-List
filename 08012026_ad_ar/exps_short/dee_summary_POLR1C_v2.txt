Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of POLR1C as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 14 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including EIF2B2 (pathways: gene expression), RANBP2 (pathways: gene expression|immune system), GATAD2B (pathways: gene expression|rna polymerase i promoter clearance|rna polymerase i transcription|rna polymerase i transcription initiation|rna polymerase i, rna polymerase iii, and mitochondrial transcription|transcription), suggesting that POLR1C may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between POLR1C–SMC1A (importance score of 0.891 and connected through pathways: gene expression), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of POLR1C in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
