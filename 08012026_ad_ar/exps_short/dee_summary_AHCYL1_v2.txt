Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of AHCYL1 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 6 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PHGDH (pathways: trans-sulfuration and one carbon metabolism), MTHFR (pathways: trans-sulfuration and one carbon metabolism), PSAT1 (pathways: trans-sulfuration and one carbon metabolism), suggesting that AHCYL1 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between AHCYL1–MTHFD1L (importance score of 0.875 and connected through pathways: trans-sulfuration and one carbon metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of AHCYL1 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
