Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of PRPS1 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 12 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PCCB (pathways: disease|metabolism), RANBP2 (pathways: carbohydrate metabolism|disease|metabolism), PNPO (pathways: disease|metabolism), suggesting that PRPS1 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between PRPS1–TPK1 (importance score of 0.866 and connected through pathways: disease|metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of PRPS1 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
