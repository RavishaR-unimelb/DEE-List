Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of GNAS as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 11 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including UNC80 (pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), L2HGDH (pathways: metabolism), SUCLA2 (pathways: metabolism), suggesting that GNAS may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between GNAS–SLC20A1 (importance score of 0.915 and connected through pathways: transmembrane transport of small molecules), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of GNAS in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
