Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of ALMS1 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 9 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including PPP2R1A (pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic|centrosome maturation|g2/m transition|loss of nlp from mitotic centrosomes|mitotic g2-g2/m phases|regulation of plk1 activity at g2/m transition), TUBB (pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic|centrosome maturation|g2/m transition|loss of nlp from mitotic centrosomes|mitotic g2-g2/m phases|regulation of plk1 activity at g2/m transition), DYNC1H1 (pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic|centrosome maturation|g2/m transition|loss of nlp from mitotic centrosomes|mitotic g2-g2/m phases|regulation of plk1 activity at g2/m transition), suggesting that ALMS1 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between ALMS1–SMC1A (importance score of 0.888 and connected through pathways: cell cycle|cell cycle, mitotic), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of ALMS1 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
