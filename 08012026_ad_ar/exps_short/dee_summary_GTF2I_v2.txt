Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of GTF2I as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 9 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including CAMK2A (pathways: b cell receptor signaling pathway), AKT1 (pathways: b cell receptor signaling pathway), IKBKG (pathways: b cell receptor signaling pathway), suggesting that GTF2I may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between GTF2I–MEF2C (importance score of 0.84 and connected through pathways: b cell receptor signaling pathway), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of GTF2I in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
