Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of NMNAT2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 11 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including STX1B (pathways: disease), ATP6V0A1 (pathways: disease), PDHA1 (pathways: metabolism), suggesting that NMNAT2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between NMNAT2–PNPO (importance score of 0.915 and connected through pathways: defective amn causes hereditary megaloblastic anemia 1|disease|metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of NMNAT2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
