Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of HTT as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 5 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including TRRAP (pathways: direct p53 effectors), SMARCA4 (pathways: direct p53 effectors), MACF1 (pathways: mesodermal commitment pathway), suggesting that HTT may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between HTT–TSC2 (importance score of 0.916 and connected through pathways: direct p53 effectors), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of HTT in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
