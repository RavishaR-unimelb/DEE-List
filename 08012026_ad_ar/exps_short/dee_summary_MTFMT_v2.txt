Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of MTFMT as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 9 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including CREBBP (pathways: organelle biogenesis and maintenance), POLG2 (pathways: organelle biogenesis and maintenance), HCFC1 (pathways: organelle biogenesis and maintenance), suggesting that MTFMT may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between MTFMT–GFM1 (importance score of 0.912 and connected through pathways: mitochondrial translation|organelle biogenesis and maintenance), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of MTFMT in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
