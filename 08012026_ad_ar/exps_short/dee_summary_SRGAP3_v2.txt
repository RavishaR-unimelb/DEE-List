Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of SRGAP3 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 11 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including GRIN1 (pathways: axon guidance|developmental biology), MEF2C (pathways: developmental biology|signaling pathways), SPTAN1 (pathways: axon guidance|developmental biology), suggesting that SRGAP3 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between SRGAP3–KCNQ2 (importance score of 0.884 and connected through pathways: axon guidance|developmental biology), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of SRGAP3 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
