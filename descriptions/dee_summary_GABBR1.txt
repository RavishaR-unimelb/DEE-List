Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of GABBR1 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 18 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including KCNQ5, GABRG2, KCNA1, suggesting that GABBR1 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between GABBR1â€“KCNQ5 (importance score: 0.914), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of GABBR1 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
