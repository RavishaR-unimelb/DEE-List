Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of AIMP2 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 17 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including EIF2B3 (pathways: gene expression), EIF2B2 (pathways: gene expression), NARS2 (pathways: trna aminoacylation, gene expression), suggesting that AIMP2 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between AIMP2â€“EIF2B3 (importance score of 0.73 and connected through pathways: gene expression), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of AIMP2 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
