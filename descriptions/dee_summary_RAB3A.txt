Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of RAB3A as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 17 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including CDKL5 (pathways: bdnf signaling pathway), STXBP1 (pathways: acetylcholine neurotransmitter release cycle, dopamine neurotransmitter release cycle, gaba synthesis, release, reuptake and degradation, glutamate neurotransmitter release cycle, neuronal system, neurotransmitter release cycle, norepinephrine neurotransmitter release cycle, transmission across chemical synapses, synaptic vesicle pathway), KCNQ2 (pathways: neuronal system), suggesting that RAB3A may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between RAB3Aâ€“CDKL5 (importance score of 0.898 and connected through pathways: bdnf signaling pathway), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of RAB3A in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
