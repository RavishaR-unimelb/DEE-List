Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of TUBA1A as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 19 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including GMPPA (pathways: metabolism of proteins), EIF2B3 (pathways: metabolism of proteins), EIF2S3 (pathways: metabolism of proteins), suggesting that TUBA1A may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between TUBA1Aâ€“GMPPA (importance score of 0.943 and connected through pathways: metabolism of proteins), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of TUBA1A in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
