Analysis of the top 20 pathway-based gene-gene interactions supporting the classification of NDUFA8 as a potential DEE-causing gene reveals several biologically meaningful patterns. These interactions, ranked by model-derived importance scores, reflect pathway-level relationships that most strongly influenced the prediction. Notably, 17 out of the top 20 edges involve known DEE genes, including STXBP1 (pathways: metabolism), NDUFV1 (pathways: metabolism, respiratory electron transport, respiratory electron transport, atp synthesis by chemiosmotic coupling, and heat production by uncoupling proteins., the citric acid (tca) cycle and respiratory electron transport, electron transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation), SUCLG1 (pathways: metabolism, the citric acid (tca) cycle and respiratory electron transport), suggesting that NDUFA8 may participate in shared disease-relevant pathways. Among the most influential links is the interaction between NDUFA8â€“STXBP1 (importance score of 0.772 and connected through pathways: metabolism), highlighting potential functional convergence in neuronal signaling. These high-scoring pathway connections provide additional support for the candidacy of NDUFA8 in DEE pathogenesis and justify its prioritization for further experimental study.
